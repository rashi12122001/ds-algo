// Problem Statement :

// Every decimal number can be changed into its binary form. Suppose your computer has itâ€™s own CoronaVirus, that eats binary digits from the right side of a number. Suppose a virus has 6 spikes, it will eat up 6 LSB binary digits in your numbers.
// You will have a bunch of numbers, and your machine will have a virus with n spikes, you have to calculate what will be the final situation of the final numbers.

// Input Format:
// First line, a single Integer N
// Second line N space separated integers of the bunch of values as array V
// Third line a single integer n, the number of spikes in Corona for Computer

// Output Format:
// Single N space separated integers denoting the final situation with the array v.

// Sample Input:
// 5
// 1 2 3 4 5
// 2

// Output:
// 0 0 0 1 1

// Explanation:
// 5 is 101 in binary, when you cut the last two binary digits, its 1.
